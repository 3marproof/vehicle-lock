# Vehicle-lock
A script for locking vehicles or unlocking vehicles.

This is a very barebone script, should be easy to modify or add on to.
currently only works if you are in a vehicle.
Do /lock to lock your vehicle
Do /unlock to unlock your vehicle

# Future Plans

### Hoping to get rid of the whole be in the vehicle process, and make it so that you actually own the vehicle to be able to lock it or unlock it
from outside and inside.

### Triggering the car alarm if someone tries to open it.

### Adding lock and unlock sound.

# Installation

please read the license

put the vehicle-lock folder in your resources folder.
